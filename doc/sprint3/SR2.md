## User Stories moved from Sprint 2:

* (TEAMO-17) As a user, I can create/join/exit fandoms via Web Page;
* (TEAMO-27) As a user, I should be able to process searching other fandoms via Web Page;
* (TEAMO-60) As a user, I can send a post in the fandom I have joined via Webpage;
* (TEAMO-39) As a developer, I can process creating and editing post by user via backend;

The previous week was intensive for every member in the tema as everyone has midterm and other assignments to finish and
therefore we could not complete all the user stories
