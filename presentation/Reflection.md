# CSCC10 Final Project Reflection

## Tools/Techniques/Conventions that worked well for TeamOf7
* RESTful API: Allow our team's backend and frontend to be separated, backend and frontend members only need to make assumptions about what kind of data and its format will be sent from the other end, without worrying about the validity. This greatly fastens the speed of coding as well as increases the code's readability. Moreover, if one of the functions is not working, we only need to fix that specific part while preventing the rest of the code from being affected.
* ReactJS: ReactJS makes creating dynamic web application easier. Unlike HTML, where creating fancy GUI requires a complex coding. In addition, web application that is created by ReactJS contains multiple components, these components are reusable which enables us to code more efficiently and create complex application using simple components.
* Google API: Google API enable our web application to display real-time map and accurate information, and it is easy to be merged into our code.
* AWS: AWS provides us a Cloud Storage to save all the files uploaded by users and allows our web application to render and display images that are stored in our Cloud Storage.
* Postman: Postman provides a clean GUI to test if information is successfully synchronized to database.

## Tell us about tools/techniques/conventions that didn't work well for TeamOf7

* Springboot: Springboot is good for simple database manipulation and queries, however if we want to establish complex relationships between entities since Springboot encapsulates too much information which makes us extremely difficult to debug what goes wrong and what causes error. Moreover, all of our team members are new to Springboot and spent too much time picking up this new tool.


## If you had to continue working as a team, and design your process, what would your process look like?
The original process works fine for our team, except ont thing that we may need to improve, that is: whenver we encountered a problem, we should report to the rest of the team immediately instead of holding back, as this could result in making the situation worse for entire team if we keep building on code that is potential harmful.
