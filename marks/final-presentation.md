- introduction:                                                                             (1/1)

    - can register accounts
    - login account
        - did not work for brand new account
        - did work for a pre-existing account
    - can change profile image as well as other user features
- fandom functionality                                                                      (2/3)
    - some of the user interface decisions need a little more work
        - examples:
            - black text on colourful backgrounds
            - some graphical glitches
                - can see posts in the corner of the page when editing a post
            - buttons are huge
            - fandom page is difficult to look at
                - doesn't display a ton of information
                - same issue with black text on colourful backgrounds
            - inconsistent CSS styling
    - all main functionalities appear to work fine
    - rating functionality
- map functionality                                                                         (3/3)
    - seemed to work fine
- some of your features are not really feature
    - e.g. cloud storage / frontend design
        - these are just aspects of your project; they are just characteristics of your application

**additional comments**:

- members were professional                                                                 (3/4)
    - most of the team is dressed pretty professionally
        - some of the team members were wearing casual clothes
    - one of the group members dropped the course
    - everyone acted professionally
- team communication                                                                        (1/2)
    - explained ok for the most part
    - would have liked some more explanation on the types of conversations you were having
        - i.e. what did you talk about during your meetings? how often did you have your meetings?
- processes + standards
    - generally explained adequately                                                        (1/2)
    - some of your standards + processes are not very unique
        - e.g. everyone used agile; this is not a noteworthy example of your process
            - what unique things did you do? was there anything that you did that you think that other teams didn't do?
            - how did you all stay organized? how did you make sure that you were all on track?
    - some general coding style standards
        - could have used a public standard (e.g. PEP8, checkstyle, tslint, eslint, ...)
- techniques                                                                                (2/2)
    - generally explained adequately
